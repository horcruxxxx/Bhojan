# Bhojan

This project features a robust tech stack, including Redux for state management, custom hooks, and re-usable components. I also implemented a powerful router and pages, and set up express servers and MongoDB databases to create models and queries, generate dummy data, and implement authentication. To top it off, I integrated payments with Stripe for a seamless checkout experience. I'm excited to showcase this project and eager to take on new challenges.
